    Users can log in and manage their own registry (create/delete registry, add/remove items) or decide to buy something from another users's registry and view their "contributions" in one place.
    Once logged in, there are three main endpoints:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item viewing their contributions: what they decided to buy for which other users
        \item manage their registry: add or remove items, see which ones are spoken for (but not by whom)
        \item browse registries: select a user and watch their list (only not-bought items and items the logged in user bought are visible), filter based on price and/or category and mark if they want to buy anything
    \end{itemize}
    Every product has a name, a category, and a price. \\
    There is a predefined list of available categories to make it easier to filter.
